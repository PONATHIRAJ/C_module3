### 1. Introduction

In high-speed electronic systems, maintaining signal integrity across interconnects is paramount. Traditional copper interconnects face challenges such as increased resistance and signal degradation at higher frequencies. Recent advancements have introduced **Cu–Carbon hybrid interconnects**, which combine copper with carbon-based materials to enhance performance. The analysis and modeling of these interconnects often utilize **ABCD parameters** (also known as transmission parameters) to characterize their behavior accurately.

### 2. ABCD Parameters Overview

ABCD parameters relate the input and output voltages and currents of a two-port network:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
V_1 \\
I_1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
A & B \\
C & D
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
V_2 \\
I_2
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Where:
- \( V_1, I_1 \): Input voltage and current
- \( V_2, I_2 \): Output voltage and current
- \( A, B, C, D \): Transmission parameters

These parameters are particularly useful for analyzing cascaded networks and are instrumental in high-frequency circuit design.

### 3. Practical Application: Cu–Carbon Hybrid Interconnects

Recent studies have demonstrated that Cu–Carbon hybrid interconnects exhibit superior performance compared to traditional copper interconnects, especially at frequencies up to 100 GHz. Key findings include:

- **Lower Impedance**: Cu–Carbon hybrids have approximately 80% lower impedance at 100 GHz compared to pure copper interconnects.
- **Enhanced Signal Transmission**: They show ~30% higher forward transmission coefficients (\( S_{21} \)) for single-line interconnects and ~38% for two-line coupled interconnects.
- **Reduced Return Loss**: The return loss coefficient (\( S_{11} \)) is reduced by ~43% in single-line configurations.

These improvements are attributed to the unique electrical properties of the carbon materials integrated into the copper matrix.

### 4. Equations and Modeling

The ABCD parameters for a transmission line can be derived using the telegrapher's equations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
V_1 &= V_2 \cosh(\gamma l) + I_2 Z_0 \sinh(\gamma l) \\
I_1 &= \frac{V_2}{Z_0} \sinh(\gamma l) + I_2 \cosh(\gamma l)
\end{aligned}
\]

Where:
- \( \gamma \): Propagation constant
- \( Z_0 \): Characteristic impedance
- \( l \): Length of the transmission line

For Cu–Carbon hybrid interconnects, these parameters are adjusted to account for the composite material properties, leading to more accurate modeling at high frequencies.

### 5. Current Research and Developments

The integration of carbon-based materials into copper interconnects is a burgeoning area of research. Studies focus on:

- **Material Composition**: Optimizing the ratio of copper to carbon to achieve desired electrical properties.
- **Manufacturing Techniques**: Developing scalable methods for producing Cu–Carbon hybrid interconnects.
- **Performance Analysis**: Utilizing ABCD parameters to model and predict the behavior of these interconnects in various configurations.

These efforts aim to address the limitations of traditional interconnects and meet the demands of next-generation high-speed electronic systems.
